			<h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
		</header>
		<section>
		<p>Typography goes back as far as humans began printing. It dates back to as early as the second millenium B.C. where humans would use it to make seals and currency in ancient times.
		 Modern Typography came around during the Digital Age, where it became digitized in Computers to display messages on computer screens and implemented in programming.</p>

			<h2>Why do we need it?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>In UX Design, Typography has become a very important pillar visually. It helps to make a webpage or product more friendly and relatable to the user. It can unconsciously sell a message or point through ways of aesthetic pleasure. In terms of Psychology and the two-factor theory, It's the cherry on top of a great User Experience and therefore a great motivator. That's what makes it so important to Design and people.</p>

		<p>Disclaimer: Due to Typography being a part of Visual Design, it can be subject to fashion trends and fads. One typeface that is popular today may be "last year" tomorrow.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<p>Typography is an ever changing field. It employs hundreds of designers in creating fonts every year, but one problem with this is the strength of powerhouses. The fonts that have been around for ages and don't need to leave. This can make it difficult for typeface designers to sell to the market. Therefore they are becoming more alternative in their approaches such as extreme sizing, superimposed fonts on images, and more artistic fonts in general. These are the trends that you can expect to keep Typography going.</P>
